# ZKTeco SDK Directory

This directory is for storing ZKTeco SDK files if needed.

## Current Implementation

Our Laravel application uses **direct TCP/IP socket communication** which doesn't require the SDK. The implementation is complete and working.

## When SDK Might Be Needed

- Advanced fingerprint template processing
- Native library integration for performance
- Reference documentation for protocol verification
- Advanced biometric operations

## Download SDK

1. Visit: https://www.zkteco.com/en/SDK
2. Download: `ZKBioModuleSDK_20210113.zip` (recommended)
3. Extract to this directory
4. Review documentation

## Quick Download

Run: `download_zkteco_sdk.bat` (Windows) to open the download page.

## Note

**You don't need the SDK for basic device communication** - our PHP implementation handles all standard operations.
